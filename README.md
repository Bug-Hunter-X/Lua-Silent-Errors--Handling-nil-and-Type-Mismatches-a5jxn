This repository demonstrates a common, yet often overlooked, issue in Lua programming: silent errors.  Many Lua functions don't explicitly handle `nil` values or type mismatches, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes. This example showcases how to use Lua's `error()` function for robust error handling. The solution demonstrates proper handling for `nil` values and type checking to prevent silent errors.
